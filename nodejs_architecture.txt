Node.js architecture is based on a single-threaded, event-driven model that efficiently handles multiple concurrent requests using non-blocking I/O operations. This allows Node.js to perform asynchronously, making it highly scalable and suitable for I/O-bound tasks like web servers and real-time applications.Node.js provides several key advantages, including high performance through the V8 engine, which compiles JavaScript into machine code for faster execution. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model efficiently handles numerous concurrent connections, making it highly scalable and ideal for real-time applications like chat apps. Additionally, Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript on both the client and server sides, streamlining the development process. The extensive npm ecosystem offers a vast range of libraries and tools, further boosting productivity and accelerating development
